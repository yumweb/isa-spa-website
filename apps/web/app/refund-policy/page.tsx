      <p>
        Our refund and returns policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have passed since your purchase, we can&rsquo;t offer you
        a full refund or exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must
        also be in the original packaging.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-returnable items</h2>
      <p>Several types of goods are exempt from being returned. The following cannot be returned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>perishable goods such as food, flowers, newspapers or magazines;</li>
        <li>intimate or sanitary goods;</li>
        <li>hazardous materials, or flammable liquids or gases;</li>
        <li>gift cards;</li>
        <li>downloadable software products;</li>
        <li>some health and personal care items.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

      <h2>Partial refunds</h2>
      <p>There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>any item not in its original condition, that is damaged or missing parts for reasons not due to our error;</li>
        <li>any item that is returned more than 30 days after delivery.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your
        returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your
        original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.
      </p>

      <h3>Late or missing refunds</h3>
      <p>
        If you haven&rsquo;t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card
        company; it may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Next, contact your bank, as there is
        often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you&rsquo;ve done all of this and you still have not
        received your refund yet, please contact us at <a href={`mailto:${SITE_CONTACT.email}`}>{SITE_CONTACT.email}</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Sale items</h3>
      <p>Only regular priced items may be refunded. Sale items cannot be refunded.</p>

      <h2>Exchanges</h2>
      <p>
        We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an
        email at <a href={`mailto:${SITE_CONTACT.email}`}>{SITE_CONTACT.email}</a> and send your item to:{" "}
        {SITE_CONTACT.address.oneLine}.
      </p>

      <h2>Gifts</h2>
      <p>
        If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you&rsquo;ll receive a gift credit
        for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the item wasn&rsquo;t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves
        to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and they will find out about your return.
      </p>

      <h2>Shipping returns</h2>
      <p>
        To return your product, you should mail your product to: {SITE_CONTACT.address.oneLine}.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are
        non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you may vary.
      </p>
